# How to run
- make sure you have gcc or other compiler installed (we will use gcc)
- C code needs to be compiled in order to run
- after you have your gcc installed ([official documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/download.html)), run this in terminal:
```
gcc main.c -o main
```
- You can replace "main.c" with any other valid path and the "main" with your desired name for the executable
- Generally:
```
gcc [additional options] [source file] -o [output file]
```
- at last, you simply run the executable. Such as this:
```
./[executable name]
```
